## Structure of Program

There is one main.cpp file with three functions. 

The createGrid function is used to create two grids that are both filled with 1's and 0's. The size of these grids is dependent on user input. The 1's and 0's are filled so that approximately 1/3 of the grid will be ones.  

The printGrid function is used to print any 2d vector. 

The compareVectors function takes in two vectors and compares each of the integers that are in the same position in the two vectors. If both integers are one, it puts a 1 into the same position in a third vector. If both integers are not one, it puts a 0 into the same position in a third vector.

## Program Status

This program works completely. There are currently no known issues.

## Testing

This program was tested on a MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey version 12.3. 

## How to Compile
